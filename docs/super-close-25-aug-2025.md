# Super Close Progress - 25 Aug 2025

## Task Summary
Implementing front-end changes to properly reflect Pro subscription status from the standardized balance response:

1. Standardize balance shape handling across the app
2. Update HeaderCredits component to show Pro status and Manage link
3. Update Usage & Billing page to reflect subscription status
4. Ensure resilience in handling various balance response shapes

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Changes

1. **Updated HeaderCredits Component**:
   - Modified to display "Pro — Unlimited" for subscribers
   - Added "Manage" link for subscribers that opens Stripe's Billing Portal
   - Kept existing behavior for non-subscribers (showing credit count and "Upgrade" link)
   - Added loading state for the "Manage" link

2. **Updated SubscriptionDetails Component**:
   - Updated ManageBillingButton to use the new Stripe portal API endpoint
   - Updated button text to "Manage Subscription" for consistency
   - Removed dependency on session token in authorization header, now using credentials: 'include'

3. **Added New API Route**:
   - Created `/app/api/stripe/portal/route.ts` endpoint
   - The endpoint creates a Stripe Billing Portal session for the current user
   - Handles authentication via Supabase session cookies
   - Includes fallback logic for finding Stripe customers by email

### Implementation Notes

- Existing code in `useCredits.ts` was already standardized to handle both `credits` and `balance` properties with `isSubscriber` as the source of truth for Pro status
- No changes were needed to the API client's schema validation, as it already supported the standardized format
- The existing `toCredits` helper function was already in place to normalize balance responses

### Testing

All QA checklist items have been implemented and should behave as expected:
- Anonymous incognito load → header shows `15` credits (polling remains 5 minutes)
- Logged-in subscriber → header shows "Pro — Unlimited" and a "Manage" link; no "Upgrade"
- Usage & Billing reflects the same states

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and user feedback for the Stripe portal redirects
2. **Loading States**: Improve loading state indicators for subscription status
3. **Cache Management**: Consider finer-grained cache invalidation when subscription status changes
