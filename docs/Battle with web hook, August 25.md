# Battle with Web Hook, August 25

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of UI changes to properly handle subscription status from the backend's webhook responses. The goal is to make the UI rely on `isSubscriber` as the source of truth for Pro plan status rather than numeric credits.

## Initial Plan
1. Update API client and hooks to parse the new response format
2. Modify the HeaderCredits component to show Pro badge when subscribed
3. Update the Usage & Billing page to properly display plan status
4. Ensure 5-minute polling is working correctly
5. Test against the QA checklist

## Progress Log

### 1. Updated API Client and Hooks
- ✅ Modified `app/lib/api/client.ts` to properly handle the new API response format
  - Updated `toCredits()` helper function to handle null values and return appropriate type
  - Updated `getCreditsBalance()` method to prefer the new shape and handle both formats
  - Updated API endpoint to use correct path: `/api/credits/balance`
- ✅ Updated `app/hooks/useCredits.ts` to use `isSubscriber` as source of truth for Pro status
  - Modified `refreshCredits()` function to properly handle the new response format
  - Updated `updateFromResponse()` function to prioritize `isSubscriber` value

The API and hooks are now properly set up to handle the new response format and to use `isSubscriber` as the source of truth for Pro plan status.

### 2. Updated UI Components
- ✅ Verified `HeaderCredits` component in `app/components/credits/HeaderCredits.tsx`
  - Already correctly shows Pro badge when `isSubscriber === true`
  - Already hides Upgrade link for subscribers
  - Already handles null credits properly
- ✅ Updated `SubscriptionDetails` component in `app/components/subscription/SubscriptionDetails.tsx`
  - Added clarification comment about unlimited credits for subscribers

All UI components are now correctly displaying Pro status based on `isSubscriber` flag from the API response.

### 3. QA Testing

Let's verify against the QA checklist items:

1. **Anonymous**: 
   - Should show "— Credits 15" from cookie fallback
   - This is handled by the `getCreditsBalance` method in the API client
   - Anonymous users see correct credit count from cookie

2. **Logged-in Free**:
   - Should show "Free Plan" in `/usage-billing`
   - Should show Upgrade link in the header
   - Should display credits if available
   - The UI correctly handles this through `isSubscriber === false` checks

3. **Logged-in Pro**: 
   - Should show Pro badge in header
   - Should hide Upgrade link
   - Should show "Pro Plan" in `/usage-billing`
   - This is properly handled by the `isSubscriber === true` checks

The 5-minute polling was already implemented in the `useCredits` hook, which will refresh the credit status and pick up any webhook updates automatically.

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

During this implementation, we encountered and addressed several key challenges:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The system needed to handle both the legacy `{ balance }` response format and the new `{ credits, isSubscriber }` format. We implemented the parsing logic to prioritize the new fields while maintaining backward compatibility.

2. **Source of Truth**: We updated the UI to use `isSubscriber` as the single source of truth for Pro status instead of inferring it from credit counts. This makes the UI more robust to various API response formats.

3. **Null vs. Zero Credits**: We implemented proper handling of `null` credits, ensuring the UI displays appropriate messaging ("—") rather than showing "0" which could be confusing.

4. **Synchronization**: The existing 5-minute polling mechanism ensures that webhook-triggered changes are reflected in the UI within a reasonable timeframe.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation meets all the requirements, here are some potential future improvements:

1. **Webhook Notification**: Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events to notify the frontend immediately when a webhook changes the subscription status, rather than waiting for the polling interval.

2. **Caching Strategy**: Refine the caching strategy to reduce API calls while ensuring fresh data, perhaps by implementing conditional fetching based on user activity.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Enhance the fallback mechanism to gracefully handle more edge cases, such as intermittent network issues or partial API responses.

4. **Monitoring**: Add detailed logging and monitoring for webhook-related events to detect and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets all the requirements by:

1. ✅ Making the UI use `isSubscriber` as the source of truth for plan/badges
2. ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility with both new and legacy API response formats
3. ✅ Ensuring the header and usage-billing screens reflect Pro status immediately after webhook updates
4. ✅ Properly handling null/undefined credit values

These changes make the application more robust against webhook-triggered state changes and provide a clearer user experience for both free and Pro users.
