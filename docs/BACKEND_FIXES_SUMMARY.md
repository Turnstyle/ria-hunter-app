# Backend API Fixes Summary

## Problem Overview
The frontend was experiencing failures with the following errors:
1. `/api/session/status` - returning 401 (endpoint didn't exist)
2. `/api/ask-stream` - returning 500 error
3. Free searches counter not decrementing for anonymous users

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created `/api/session/status` Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/session/status/route.ts`

This new endpoint:
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Returns current search counts and subscription status
- Uses the demo-session cookie system for tracking anonymous users
- Returns proper CORS headers

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "searchesRemaining": 5,
  "searchesUsed": 0,
  "isSubscriber": false,
  "isAuthenticated": false,
  "totalAllowed": 5
}
```

### 2. Fixed `/api/ask-stream` Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/ask-stream/route.ts`

Fixed issues:
- Removed incorrect usage of `incrementDemoSession` with streaming responses
- Now properly sets the demo session cookie in response headers
- Added metadata to the SSE stream including remaining searches
- Improved error handling to always send proper completion markers

### 3. Updated Middleware Configuration
**File:** `middleware.ts`

- Added `/api/session/status` to the `skipAuthPaths` array so it doesn't require authentication
- This allows anonymous users to check their session status

### 4. Updated Demo Session Library
**File:** `lib/demo-session.ts`

- Exported constants (`DEMO_SEARCHES_ALLOWED`, etc.) for use in other modules
- These are now used by the new session status endpoint

## How the System Works Now

1. **Anonymous Users:**
   - Get 5 free searches tracked via the `rh_demo` cookie
   - Cookie persists for 24 hours
   - Each search increments the counter
   - `/api/session/status` returns remaining searches

2. **Authenticated Users (Non-Subscribers):**
   - Also limited to 5 searches (demo limit)
   - Same tracking mechanism as anonymous users

3. **Subscribers:**
   - Unlimited searches
   - `/api/session/status` returns `searchesRemaining: -1` to indicate unlimited

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Open the app in an incognito/private browser window
2. Check the console - should no longer see 401 or 500 errors
3. Ask a question in the chat
4. Check that "5 free searches remaining" decrements to "4 free searches remaining"
5. Continue asking questions to verify the counter decrements properly

### Automated Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
# For local development
node test_backend_endpoints.js

# For production
API_BASE_URL=https://ria-hunter.vercel.app node test_backend_endpoints.js
```

The test script will:
1. Test `/api/session/status` for anonymous users
2. Test `/api/session/status` with auth headers
3. Test `/api/ask` non-streaming endpoint
4. Test `/api/ask-stream` streaming endpoint
5. Verify search counts decrement properly

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- No more 401 errors for `/api/session/status`
- No more 500 errors for `/api/ask-stream`
- Search counter properly decrements from 5 to 0
- Anonymous users are properly limited to 5 searches
- Subscribers have unlimited searches

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/session/status/route.ts` - Created new endpoint
2. `app/api/ask-stream/route.ts` - Fixed streaming and session tracking
3. `middleware.ts` - Added session/status to skipAuthPaths
4. `lib/demo-session.ts` - Exported constants for reuse

## Files Created
1. `app/api/session/status/route.ts` - New session status endpoint
2. `test_backend_endpoints.js` - Test script for verification
3. `BACKEND_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Notes

After deploying these changes:
1. The frontend should automatically start working without any frontend changes
2. The session tracking will begin working for new anonymous users
3. Existing users may need to refresh their browser for the changes to take effect

## Cleanup

The test script (`test_backend_endpoints.js`) can be removed after verification:
```bash
rm test_backend_endpoints.js
```
