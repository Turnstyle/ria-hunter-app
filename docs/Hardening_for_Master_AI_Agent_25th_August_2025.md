# Hardening for Master AI Agent 25th August 2025

## Tasks Overview

1. Update client fetcher for `/_backend/api/balance` to parse standardized API response
2. Update HeaderCredits component to show Pro pill and hide Upgrade link for subscribers
3. Update Usage & Billing page to show "Managed via Stripe" for subscribers and remove Upgrade CTA
4. Maintain 5-minute background refresh without UI blocking on fetch failure

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Updated Client Fetcher to Parse Standardized API Response

- Reviewed the API client implementation in `app/lib/api/client.ts`
- The `CreditBalanceResponseSchema` already had the correct structure:
  ```ts
  type BalanceResp = { credits: number; isSubscriber: boolean; balance?: number };
  ```
- The implementation was already correctly prioritizing `credits` over `balance` when both are present
- Added clearer comments to indicate that the code follows the standardized API response format

### 2. Updated HeaderCredits Component 

- Modified the subscriber display to show a Pro pill:
  - Added a green rounded pill with "Pro" text
  - Kept the infinity icon and "Unlimited" text
  - Maintained the "Manage" link for subscribers
- Ensured the "Upgrade" link is only shown for non-subscribers
- Free user display correctly shows credits when available
- When credits are null/undefined, it displays "â€” Credits" but doesn't disable input

### 3. Updated Usage & Billing Page

- The SubscriptionDetails component (used in Usage & Billing page) already showed "Managed via Stripe" for subscribers
- Verified that the "Upgrade to Pro" button is only shown for non-subscribers, and "Manage Subscription" button is shown for subscribers

### 4. Maintained 5-Minute Background Refresh

- The existing implementation in `useCredits` hook already handles background refresh without UI blocking
- The refresh mechanism is resilient to network hiccups:
  - Uses cached values when network requests fail
  - Doesn't disable the UI when credits are unavailable
  - Returns null instead of disabling functionality when credits can't be fetched

## Deployment Status

- Successfully deployed changes to Vercel production environment
- Deployment ID: `dpl_ELiW2FeazySszmM8q3ws4d4g7JUS`
- Production URL: https://ria-hunter-58ee8glvv-turnerpeters-6002s-projects.vercel.app
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- Deployment is now in "Ready" state

## Issues Encountered

- No major issues encountered
- The codebase was already well-structured with most of the required functionality in place
- The main improvements were in the UI components and making the error handling more resilient

## Testing Performed

- Verified the credit balance fetching logic in the API client
- Checked that the HeaderCredits component displays correctly for both subscribers and non-subscribers
- Confirmed that the Usage & Billing page displays the appropriate information based on subscription status
- Verified that the background refresh doesn't block the UI on network failures

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing unit tests for the credit balance functionality
- Add more detailed error logging for credit balance fetch failures
- Consider adding visual feedback when credit refresh fails (currently silently falls back to cached values)
