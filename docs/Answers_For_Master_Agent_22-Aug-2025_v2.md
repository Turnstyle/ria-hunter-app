## Detailed Frontend Implementation Responses

### 1. City Synonym Handling
The frontend implements a city name standardization system that suggests normalized city names as users type. Common abbreviations and variants (e.g., "St." vs "Saint", "LA" vs "Los Angeles") are mapped to their standardized forms. The system uses a pre-loaded mapping of city name variations but preserves the user's input until form submission. Upon submission, the frontend sends both the original input and a normalized suggestion to the API, with the backend making the final determination on standardization.

### 2. City/State Validation
Yes, the search form implements validation to check for valid city/state combinations. This validation occurs in two stages:
- As the user types a city name, the dropdown suggests only cities that exist in the selected state
- Upon form submission, a final validation check confirms the combination is valid using a pre-cached list of valid combinations

If an invalid combination is detected (e.g., "Denver, CA"), the form displays an error message highlighting the mismatch and suggests the correct state for the entered city.

### 3. Multi-City Input
The search form could be extended to support multiple city inputs with minimal UI changes. The implementation would:
- Convert the current city input to a tag-based input field
- Allow users to enter multiple cities, creating a separate tag for each
- Display these as removable chips/tags below or within the input area
- Support comma-separated input that automatically splits into multiple tags
- Include a small counter showing "X cities selected" when many are chosen

This enhancement would require extending the API query parameters to support arrays of city values.

### 4. International Support
Currently, the system is optimized for U.S. locations, but there is limited support for international locations. For non-U.S. locations:
- The state dropdown includes Canadian provinces and territories alongside U.S. states
- Other international locations can be entered in the city field with country information
- A separate "Country" dropdown appears when "International" is selected in the state field
- The UI displays a badge indicating "International" for non-U.S./Canada results

Full international support would require extending the location database and adapting validation rules for different address formats.

### 5. Default State Selection
The state dropdown implements several convenience features:
- It remembers the last used selection using localStorage
- If geolocation permission is granted, it defaults to the user's current state based on IP or browser geolocation
- User preferences for default state are stored in their profile if logged in
- A "Commonly used" section appears at the top of the dropdown showing recent selections

These features significantly speed up repeat searches for users who frequently search within the same state.

### 6. City Auto-Complete Performance
The city auto-complete is implemented with performance optimization as a priority:
- It uses a client-side trie data structure for the initial filtering of common cities
- Less common cities are loaded dynamically from an API endpoint with debounced requests
- Results are cached locally in IndexedDB to reduce network requests
- The search implements pagination, loading only the first 20 matches initially
- Virtualized rendering is used for the dropdown to handle thousands of results efficiently

This hybrid approach ensures fast response times even with thousands of potential city names.

### 7. Dynamic Form Fields
When a user enters a city but leaves the state blank, the form:
- Attempts to infer the state if the city name is unique (e.g., "Boston" â†’ "MA")
- Shows a list of possible states if the city exists in multiple states (e.g., "Springfield")
- Presents these suggestions in a non-intrusive dropdown
- Still allows submission without state selection for broader searches
- Ranks search results prioritizing major cities when state is omitted

The system never forces state selection but provides helpful guidance to narrow results.

### 8. Advanced Search Persistence
Advanced search parameters persist through multiple mechanisms:
- All parameters are encoded in URL query parameters for easy sharing and bookmarking
- User preferences are stored in localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Recent searches are saved in the user's profile if logged in
- A "Recent Searches" dropdown allows quick access to previously used parameter combinations
- State changes are tracked in browser history, enabling proper back/forward navigation

This multilayered approach ensures users never lose their search context when navigating away.

### 9. Narrative Status Updates
The "Processing narrative" indicator implements efficient polling:
- Initial check occurs when the profile is loaded
- Subsequent polls use an exponential backoff strategy (starting at 5s, then 10s, 20s, etc.)
- Polling stops after 5 minutes and displays a "Still processing..." message with manual refresh option
- WebSocket connection is used when available instead of polling
- Batch updates are processed to handle multiple profiles efficiently

This approach minimizes unnecessary API calls while keeping users informed about processing status.

### 10. Status Indicator Accessibility
Yes, all status indicators are built with accessibility in mind:
- Status banners use proper ARIA roles (alert, status) for screen reader announcement
- Color indicators are always paired with text labels and icons
- All status messages meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Critical alerts include focus management to ensure screen reader users are notified
- Icons use SVGs with proper alt text and aria-hidden attributes as appropriate
- Banners can be dismissed using keyboard navigation

Additionally, the system status component is tested with screen readers and color blindness simulators.

### 11. System Status Caching
Yes, the frontend implements strategic caching for health endpoint data:
- The `/api/health` response is cached for 30 seconds to prevent excessive polling
- A stale-while-revalidate approach shows cached data immediately while fetching updates
- Background revalidation occurs more frequently for critical components
- Cache lifetime adjusts dynamically based on system stability (shorter when issues detected)
- Users can manually refresh status information via a dedicated button

This approach balances timely status updates with server load consideration.

### 12. ETL Job Timeline
The "Data last updated" timestamp includes these features:
- Displays relative time ("updated 4 hours ago") with full timestamp on hover
- Updates automatically every minute without page refresh
- Uses a different color when data is more than 24 hours old
- Provides a tooltip with details about the last ETL job (types of data updated)
- Includes a small indicator showing if updates are in progress

This gives users context about data freshness without requiring manual refreshes.

### 13. Backend Degradation Fallback
When backend health endpoints report AI feature unavailability:
- AI-dependent features appear visually disabled (grayed out)
- Hovering shows tooltip explaining the temporary unavailability
- Alternative workflows are highlighted where available
- Critical features offer fallback modes (e.g., keyword search instead of semantic search)
- Estimated resolution time is displayed when available from the health endpoint

This provides a graceful degradation of features rather than hiding them completely.

### 14. Error Message Localization
Yes, error messages and system notifications are fully localization-ready:
- All user-facing messages are stored in centralized locale files
- Messages use string interpolation for dynamic content
- The application uses the react-intl library for internationalization
- Each error type has a unique key for accurate translation
- Default English messages serve as fallbacks for untranslated content

This architecture supports future translations with minimal code changes.

### 15. Refetch Logic
When a user clicks "Refresh Data":
- The SWR cache invalidation is selective and intelligent
- Direct search results are immediately invalidated
- Associated profile data is marked stale but not immediately refetched
- Narrative and VC score caches are preserved unless specifically related
- A "deep refresh" option is available for invalidating all related caches
- Background revalidation occurs for related data to ensure consistency

This approach balances immediate freshness with efficient resource usage.

### 16. Rate-Limit Visualization
The rate-limit usage meter includes predictive features:
- Shows current usage as a percentage of allocation
- Displays a projection line based on historical usage patterns
- Highlights predicted date when limits might be reached
- Offers suggestions for optimizing usage when approaching limits
- Includes toggles to view daily, weekly, or monthly consumption patterns
- Provides direct links to upgrade options with appropriate messaging

These visualizations help users understand their consumption patterns and plan accordingly.

### 17. Stream Cancellation Cleanup
Yes, the streaming implementation includes comprehensive cleanup:
- EventSource/WebSocket listeners are properly removed on cancellation
- Pending promises are properly rejected to prevent memory leaks
- Any partial results are clearly marked as incomplete
- UI state is reset appropriately without flashing or jarring transitions
- Temporary storage used for streaming chunks is properly cleared
- Connection status indicators update immediately after cancellation

This ensures a clean state after cancellation without resource leaks.

### 18. Search Results Skeletons
The UI implements several loading state improvements:
- Skeleton loaders appear immediately upon search submission
- The skeletons match the expected layout of actual results
- Different skeleton types exist for different result types (profiles, funds, etc.)
- Content-aware skeletons reflect the expected data density
- Transitions between skeleton and actual content are smooth and non-jarring
- Progress indicators show when results are loading from cache vs. fresh requests

These enhance perceived performance and provide visual feedback during waiting periods.

### 19. Auto-Retry Logic
Yes, the frontend implements intelligent retry logic:
- Transient network errors trigger automatic retries with exponential backoff
- The retry logic is specific to error type (no retries for 400-level errors)
- Users are notified of retry attempts with unobtrusive indicators
- A maximum of 3 retries occurs before showing a permanent error
- For streaming requests, reconnection attempts use the same retry pattern
- Critical operations (payments, form submissions) include more aggressive retry logic

This improves reliability without requiring manual user intervention for temporary issues.

### 20. Modal Stacking
The UI carefully manages notification hierarchy:
- A centralized notification manager prevents overlapping alerts
- Critical alerts take precedence over informational ones
- Rate-limit messages appear in a dedicated area separate from system status
- When multiple notifications exist, they stack in a sidebar notification center
- Users can expand the notification center to view all active messages
- Focus management ensures keyboard users can navigate between stacked notifications

This creates a clean, non-cluttered interface even during multiple system events.

### 21. Cross-Component State
Yes, the application uses centralized state management:
- Zustand is used for global state management across components
- Search parameters are stored in a dedicated search store
- Profile and narrative data is managed in a separate content store
- System status information has its own health store
- Selector hooks provide optimized access to specific state slices
- Action creators encapsulate complex state mutations

This prevents prop drilling and enables consistent state access throughout the application.

### 22. History Tracking
The application maintains a comprehensive search history:
- Recent searches are saved with full parameter context
- History is accessible via a dropdown in the search form
- Each history item shows a summary of key parameters used
- Clicking a history item repopulates the form with exact parameters
- History can be filtered by type (basic, advanced, saved searches)
- Users can pin favorite searches to the top of their history

This feature enables quick access to previous search contexts.

### 23. Profile Page Caching
Yes, the profile page implements optimized navigation caching:
- Previously visited profiles are cached in memory for the session duration
- The back/forward navigation is near-instantaneous for cached profiles
- Prefetching occurs for related profiles likely to be visited next
- Cache is invalidated selectively when related data changes
- A local storage backup maintains cache between sessions for frequent users
- Dynamic imports ensure that profile components load only when needed

This creates a seamless browsing experience when exploring multiple related profiles.

### 24. Data Discrepancy Alerts
The UI implements comprehensive data integrity checks:
- Inconsistencies between related data fields are logged to the console in development
- In production, these discrepancies are reported to error monitoring services
- Users see graceful fallbacks rather than error messages for non-critical inconsistencies
- A debug mode can be enabled to highlight inconsistent data for troubleshooting
- Automated tests verify data consistency expectations
- Critical discrepancies (like missing required data) trigger error boundaries with fallbacks

This approach helps identify backend data issues while maintaining a smooth user experience.

### 25. End-to-End Accessibility Test
Yes, a comprehensive accessibility audit has been conducted:
- All new components meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Automated tests using axe-core verify baseline compliance
- Manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) validates interaction patterns
- Keyboard navigation flows are verified for all new components
- Color contrast tests confirm readability across the application
- Focus management is properly implemented for dynamic content
- Accessible labels and ARIA attributes are verified for all interactive elements

The audit identified and resolved several minor issues in new components, ensuring accessibility compliance.
