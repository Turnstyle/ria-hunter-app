# ChatGPT Master AI Plan 25 August 2025

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Master AI agent's plan to fix frontend issues in the RIA Hunter app.

## Plan Summary
1. Update API client parsing to handle both legacy and new balance response formats
2. Fix HeaderCredits component display
3. Update Usage & Billing page
4. Ensure chat input is never disabled due to credits fetch issues
5. Maintain existing polling mechanism
6. Keep current SSE stream parser
7. Perform visual QA

## Progress
- [x] Created tracking document
- [x] Update balance fetcher in API client
  - Added `toCredits()` helper function to standardize balance/credits format
  - Updated schema to handle both legacy and new response formats
  - Ensured cache 'no-store' is maintained
- [x] Fix HeaderCredits component
  - Changed "Pro Plan (Unlimited)" to "Pro" for subscribers
  - Only show Upgrade link for non-subscribers
- [x] Update Usage & Billing page
  - Show "Pro Plan" instead of "Pro Subscriber"
  - Added "Managed via Stripe" text for subscribers
  - Handle null credits display
- [x] Verify chat input functionality
  - Confirmed that input is never disabled due to credits fetch issues
  - Only disabled for isSubmitting || isStreaming
- [x] Check polling mechanism
  - Confirmed 5-minute refresh interval is in place (CREDITS_CACHE_DURATION)
  - First fetch happens on mount
- [x] Verify SSE stream parser
  - Current implementation already handles both plain text tokens and JSON responses
  - Tolerant parsing with fallback to raw text when JSON parsing fails
- [x] Perform visual QA
  - For anonymous users:
    - Header should show credits (15 expected for anonymous users)
    - Upgrade link should be visible
  - For subscribers:
    - Header should show "Pro" badge
    - No Upgrade link should be visible
    - Usage & Billing page should show "Pro Plan" and "Managed via Stripe"
- [x] Push changes to GitHub
- [x] Verify Vercel deployment
  - First deployment failed due to TypeScript errors
  - Fixed issues with handling potentially undefined credits values
  - Successfully deployed to Vercel after fixes

## Issues and Notes
- The API client has been updated to handle both legacy `{ balance }` and new `{ credits }` response formats
- The `toCredits()` helper ensures we always have a consistent format regardless of which API shape is returned
- HeaderCredits now properly shows "Pro" for subscribers and hides the Upgrade link
- Fixed TypeScript errors:
  1. In useCredits hook to handle potentially undefined credits values
  2. In api/client.ts getSubscriptionStatus method to also handle potentially undefined credits
- Vercel deployments failed initially due to TypeScript errors, which have been fixed

## Summary of Changes
1. Added `toCredits()` helper function to standardize balance/credits format
2. Updated API client to handle both legacy `{ balance }` and new `{ credits }` response formats
3. Fixed HeaderCredits component to display "Pro" badge for subscribers and hide the Upgrade link
4. Updated Usage & Billing page to correctly show plan status and "Managed via Stripe" for subscribers
5. Fixed TypeScript errors related to potentially undefined credits values
6. Successfully deployed all changes to Vercel production

## Conclusion
All the requested changes have been implemented and deployed successfully. The UI now properly handles the standardized balance shape, shows the correct plan status, and never blocks input due to credits fetch issues. The application is now more robust in handling different API response formats and edge cases.
