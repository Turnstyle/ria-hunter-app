## Bugs & Issues Log

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-001 | API | Mock implementation of search and answer endpoints needs replacement with real implementation once backend RIA data is loaded | medium | open | The frontend components are implemented with proper interfaces, but the API routes contain mock data to facilitate development.
