# RIA Hunter UI Fixes - 100 Word Summary

I implemented robust frontend improvements to the RIA Hunter app to handle standardized balance response formats. This included creating a `toCredits()` helper function to normalize both legacy and new API response formats, updating the HeaderCredits component to display a "Pro" badge for subscribers, fixing the Usage & Billing page to show proper plan status, and ensuring chat input is never disabled due to credits fetch issues. Fixed critical TypeScript errors related to potentially undefined credits values and successfully deployed all changes to Vercel. The application now gracefully handles various API response formats and edge cases for both anonymous and subscribed users.
