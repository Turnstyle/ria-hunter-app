# RIA Hunter API & Proxy Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Proxy Configuration
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to proxy to wrong backend URL (`ria-hunter.vercel.app`)
- **Solution**: Removed unnecessary proxy rewrites since backend is on same domain
- **Status**: Backend is correctly accessible at `https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/*`

### 2. üî¥ CRITICAL: Backend Bypasses Semantic Search
- **Problem**: The `executeEnhancedQuery` function in backend completely bypasses AI/semantic search
- **Evidence**: 
  - Test query returns `searchStrategy: semantic-first` but no similarity scores
  - No actual semantic search being performed
  - Falls back to basic structured database queries
- **Impact**: Users get non-AI results even though they're told it's using AI

### 3. üî¥ CRITICAL: Credits Not Decrementing
- **Problem**: Credits counter shows 4 and doesn't decrease after queries
- **Evidence**: API response metadata doesn't include `remaining` credits field
- **Likely Cause**: Backend not properly tracking/deducting credits on `/api/ask` endpoint

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Session-Based Demo Mode Active
- **Evidence**: Response sets cookie `rh_demo=1` 
- **Impact**: Might be using demo mode instead of real credits system

## Test Results

### API Test Output:
```
‚úÖ Response received from https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/ask
üìä Response structure:
  - Has answer: true
  - Has results: false (0 items)
  - Has metadata: true

üí≥ Credit Information:
  - Remaining credits: NOT PROVIDED ‚ùå
  - Is subscriber: false
  - Search strategy: semantic-first (but not actually using it!)
  - Query type: superlative-largest

ü§ñ AI/Semantic Search Status:
  - Used semantic search: ‚ùå NO
```

## Required Backend Fixes

### 1. Fix `executeEnhancedQuery` Function
The backend team needs to:
- Replace the current `executeEnhancedQuery` that bypasses semantic search
- Implement proper semantic-first search as documented in `docs/Rewire_ria_hunter_ai_implementation_plan_27-Aug-2025.md`
- Ensure similarity scores are returned with results

### 2. Fix Credit Tracking
The backend team needs to:
- Ensure credits are properly deducted on `/api/ask` endpoint
- Return `remaining` credits in response metadata
- Verify the credits ledger system is working

### 3. Disable Demo Mode for Authenticated Users
- Check why `rh_demo=1` cookie is being set
- Ensure authenticated users use real credits, not demo mode

## Files Changed

1. **next.config.js** - Removed incorrect proxy rewrites
2. **vercel.json** - Removed redundant rewrites
3. **env.example** - Already updated to use `AI_PROVIDER=google`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to remove the incorrect proxy configuration
2. **Contact backend team** to fix the `executeEnhancedQuery` bypass issue
3. **Test credit decrementing** after backend fixes are deployed
4. **Verify semantic search** is actually being used with similarity scores

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl -s https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query": "largest RIA firms in St. Louis"}' | jq '.'

# Check session status
curl -s https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/session/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" | jq '.'
```
